# Inverse_Perspective_Mapping

IPM_Calculate_Matrix contains the openCV solution code for calculation the homography matrix. in this case we have used a checker box image. the output of the homography matrix is stored in file H.txt. copy the matrix data from H.txt to the code in IPM_Image_Output to get the proper Inverse Perspective Mapped Image.

IPM_Image_Output contains the code for the getting the Inverse Perspective Map of an image. Data from H.txt of IPM_Calculate_Matrix should be edtered into the code for the proper output.
